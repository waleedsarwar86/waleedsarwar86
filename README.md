Iâ€™m an Android developer with over 7 years of experience in building high-quality and meaningful products mostly in startups.

I have experience building, releasing, and maintaining complex Mobile applications. Strives for elegance and simplicity in code while focusing on reusability and best practices. Expert in building scalable architecture in Mobile applications using MVP, MVVM and Clean Architecture. Meticulous, with keen attention to detail, with strong analytical and communication skills I learn every day because I think that learning is a continuous process. I feel that making mistakes is not a crime but not learning from mistakes is
